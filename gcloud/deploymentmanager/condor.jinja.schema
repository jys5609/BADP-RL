  title: A template for creating a condor cluster.
  author: Google, Inc.
  description: |
    This template creates a HTCondor cluster for high-throughput computing.
    HTCondor is open source software developed by the University of Wisc and
    is used extensively by the science community.

    Creates one master node, one job submission node, and n compute nodes
    through a managed instance group.

    The base image is Debian 8, and the configuration installs the latest
    production version of HTCondor.
